This is the Readme for the BootlegShell program.

Upon startup you will be greeted with a command prompt.

(Cmd)

Type help to see a list of commands.
Type help (command you want to learn about) to learn about the command. Ex. help hello

To begin running commands use the CDR command to bring you to this prompt.

You will then be asked to type your command. Text files being written to and read from need to be created beforehand.

Please also create a pipe1.txt if it doesn't already exist.

I didn't receive any help from classmates on this project.
